# Define the variables
principal = 1000   # initial investment
rate = 0.05        # annual interest rate (5%)
time = 3           # time in years

# Calculate simple interest using the formula: I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result
print("The simple interest is:", interest)
